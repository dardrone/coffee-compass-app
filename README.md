# The Coffee Compass Mobile App

The Coffee Compass mobile app is for helping coffee lovers (addicts?) find shops recommended by the editors at [The Coffee Compass] and also for reviewing content on [The Coffee Compass].

While the app is specifically for [The Coffee Compass], it can serve as a template for miscellaneous location reviews powered by [Wordpress].

### Technology
The Coffee Compass mobile app is an [Ionic] app, which leverages [AngularJS], the [Apache Cordova] framework, and  builds natively to iOS and Android devices. We're using the Wordpress plugin [JSON API] to expose our site as a RESTful web service which serves up the content for the app via HTTP calls. We are tagging our posts via the [WP Geo] plugin in order to add geotagging metadata post fields. We've built a custom PHP controller for the [JSON API] plugin that pulls posts by the tagged geolocation data.

### Installation

You need the [Ionic] framework, (along with [NPM] and [Bower]). You'll want to check out [Ionic: Getting Started] if you haven't already.

```sh
$ ionic serve
